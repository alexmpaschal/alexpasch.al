I'm a student at UNC Chapel Hill studying mathematics. I serve as an officer for the Carolina Math Club, perform research on superabundant numbers with Dr. Idris Assani and another undergraduate, am an Undergraduate Learning Assistant for MATH 521 (Advanced Calculus I), and more. This summer, I'll be researching dynamical systems and ergodic theory at Ohio State University through the ROMUS program.

I'm currently planning a lecture series on GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems, and hope to study some set theory in the near future. In the philosophical real, I'm interested in phenomenology and existentialism, as well as many classical texts (e.g. *Beyond Good and Evil* by Friederich Nietzsche). Additionally, I enjoy reading literature, writing, rock climbing, listening to jazz and classical music, and a host of other activities.

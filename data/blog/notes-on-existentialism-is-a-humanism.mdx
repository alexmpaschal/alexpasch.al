## Background
*Existentialism is a Humanism*, published in 1946, 
is based on an unexpectedly popular lecture Jean-Paul 
Sartre gave to Club Maintenant in Paris on October 29, 
1945 wherein he sought to defend his philosophy from 
certain charges brought forth by Marxists, Christians, 
and other philosophers. Though he’d come to denounce the 
views espoused in this lecture, it still serves as a 
gateway into existentialism and, in particular, his more radical *Being 
and Nothingness*, published three years prior.

## Definitions
Existentialism: Sartre defines existentialism as the 
belief that existence precedes essence. To clarify 
this definition, he gives the example of a paper knife. 
Paper knives were not created without a purpose, but 
rather, they were conceived by man for the purpose of 
cutting paper. One does not see a paper knife and wonder 
what it’s for, since its existence is a means to an end. 
Thus, for paper knives, essence precedes existence. 
Further, Sartre claims that in every historical conception 
of God, humans are to God what paper knives are to man, 
and so the existence of God implies that, for man, essence 
precedes existence. If man didn’t create paper knives, 
then they would exist without an essence, and similarly, 
if God doesn’t exist (as Sartre believes), man’s existence 
must precede his essence.

Anguish: Sartre argues that since God doesn’t exist, 
there are no absolute morals. Instead, when one makes 
a choice for himself, he makes it for all of mankind, 
having established his own morality. If he chooses, 
say, to have kids, he has decided that it’d be best if 
all of mankind had kids. Anguish, then, “is the total 
absence of justification accompanied, at the same time, 
by responsibility toward all.”

Abandonment: Dostoevsky said that “if God did not exist, 
everything would be permitted.” Indeed, Sartre agrees 
that everything is permitted (though an ethics may still 
be established: see, for example, *The Ethics of Ambiguity* 
by Simone de Beauvoir)—man is thrown into such a world 
without his permission, condemned to such freedom in the 
face of the aforementioned grave responsibility.

Despair: Consider a man who just arrived at a train station 
and is now waiting for his friend, who should arrive there 
in about 20 minutes. But what if his train’s conductor took 
an elongated smoke break, or what if he missed his train, 
or what if his train derailed? All these events are possible, 
and since God doesn’t exist, he can’t will his friend a safe 
and timely arrival. The man stands at the station in despair 
because he has no hope that his friend will arrive on time, 
or at all—no hope in the things he can’t control.

Bad faith: At a basic level, to be in bad faith is to live 
contrary to your radical freedom. This includes, but is 
not limited to, lying to yourself, ascribing identities to 
yourself (e.g. “I did that because I am ____”), and advocating 
against the freedom of others.

Sartre’s unconventional definition of humanism will come later.

## Charges Against Existentialism
1. Existentialism bars off all paths to "solutions" in life,
making one dwell in the quietism of despair.
2. Existentialism emphasizes the negatives of life, neglecting
the positives.
3. Existentialism, being a purely subjective doctrine (see,
for example, the definition of anguish), makes it impossible for
one to "regain solidarity with other men who exist outside the self."
4. Existentialism, in allowing one to do whatever he likes,
renders him incapable of condemning the viewpoint or action of another.

## Sartre's Responses
1. Existentialism defines man by his actions. 
(Why not also by his intentions? Sartre gives the 
following example: “I may say that I love a certain 
friend enough to sacrifice such or such a sum of money 
for him, but I cannot prove that unless I have done it.”) 
This encourages man towards action, since it says that 
there is no hope but in action. Thus, existentialism is 
not a philosophy of quietism.
2. Existentialism places the destiny of man within himself, 
which is not pessimistic, but rather optimistic.
3. The existentialist recognizes that he cannot be anything 
unless others recognize him as such (e.g. the emphasis on 
action over intention). Thus, the existentialist, instead 
of being separated from others, is drawn towards them.
4. Sartre breaks this charge into three parts: 1) 
one can do whatever he likes, 2) one cannot judge another’s 
viewpoint or action, and 3) one’s values, being chosen 
by himself, shouldn’t be taken seriously, and responds as follows:
    1. One may, indeed, do whatever he likes, but he also cannot 
    avoid being fully responsible for his situation, which is 
    solely the result of his choices.
    2. One may judge others logically that certain choices are 
    based on error or that they’re acting in bad faith, and 
    morally that they’re in bad faith.
    3. Since God does not exist, one must choose his own values. 
    Thus, the conclusion is erroneous, for there are no other options.

## Human ~~Nature~~ Condition
Prior to Sartre, atheists relied on the existence of a universal human 
nature to form the basis of human morality. Sartre 
rejects this, and instead claims that a universal human 
condition—being a temporally bound entity condemned to 
freedom—exists. Human universality, then, is constructed 
when man chooses himself, and thus all others.

## Humanism
Here, Sartre defines humanism not as being in admiration of man, 
but rather as the following belief:

>Man is always outside of himself, and it is in projecting and 
losing himself beyond himself that man is realized; and, on 
the other hand, it is in pursuing transcendent goals that he 
is able to exist.

Existentialism is a humanism because it reminds man that he is 
the only legislator, that he must decide for himself, and that 
he can only realize himself by seeking liberation beyond himself.
